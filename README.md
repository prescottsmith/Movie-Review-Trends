# Movie-Review-Trends

In this project, my aim was to gain insight into how some of the top movie-rating websites review different movies. As a lover of tv and cinema, I am always   looking for new things to watch, and appreciate being able to go to a given site and receive reliable recommendations. However, some sites may be more biased than others towards certain types of movies. I wanted to see if I could 
find correlations between certain details of a movie, and a rating sites' review of them.

Are older movies favored over newer movies?
Does runtime play a significant role?
Are more mature movies given better reviews?
Are some sites more biased than others?
